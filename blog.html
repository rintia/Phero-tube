        <p><span class="font-semibold">Ans:</span> REST(Representational State Transfer) API is a way of accessing web services in a simple and flexible way. In HTTP there are five methods that are commonly used in a REST-based architecture. The are POST, GET, PUT, PATCH and DELETE. These correspond to create, read, update, and delete (or CRUD) operations respectively. A request is sent from client to server in the form of a web URL as HTTP GET or POST or PUT or PATCH or DELETE request. After that, a response comes back from the server in the form of JSON. </p>
